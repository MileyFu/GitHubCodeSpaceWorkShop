# **GitHub Codespaces Introduction**

<img src="./imgs/00/logo.png" />

GitHub Codespaces allows you to not only maintain your code as usual on GitHub, but now you can also compile your project, allowing you to directly complete your research and development tasks and the content of open source projects directly through the cloud. With GitHub Codespaces, you can learn programming languages, develop projects, and maintain code anytime, anywhere on any device. The biggest advantage is that you no longer need to spend any time configuring different environments for learning or completing an application, and you can quickly maintain your project on any device anywhere. On GitHub Universe 2022, every GitHub user will get 60 hours of exclusive usage per month.

## **What is GitHub Codespaces**

GitHub Codespaces is a development environment hosted in the cloud. You can customize projects for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your Repo (often referred to as configuration as code), which creates a repeatable GitHub Codespaces configuration for all users of the project. Each codespace runs on a GitHub-hosted virtual machine. You can choose the type of machine to use based on the resources you need. Offer needs to provide various types of machines. You can connect to CodeSpace from a browser, Visual Studio Code, the JetBrains Gateway application, or using the GitHub CLI.

GitHub Codespaces are for personal and business development. As long as your device has a browser, you can use GitHub Codespaces, allowing you to write and manage your code more efficiently.

## **How to use GitHub Codespaces**

### **Scene one**

Log in to your GitHub, select "Codespaces" in the upper navigation bar, and you can enter your Codespaces environment.

You can create your different applications based on different templates. The templates are still limited at this stage, mainly for Python, Ruby, and JavaScript technologies. Of course, you can also use empty templates to build solutions for different application scenarios based on different programming languages.

### **Scene Two**

If you want to target a Repo on GitHub, you can also fork it, select Codespaces, and enter the corresponding environment

### **Scene Three**

You can enable your Codespaces through local Visual Studio Code and related Jetbrains IDEs

## **Environment settings for GitHub Codespaces**

### **Cloud Hardware**

There are different hardware on GitHub Codespaces, you can build better hardware according to your needs

You can modify the relevant content according to the changes of the project

### **About Dev container**

When you work in GitHub Codespaces, the environment you work in is created using a development container, or development container, hosted on a virtual machine.

A development container, or dev container, is a Docker container specifically configured to provide a fully functional development environment. Whenever you work in codespace, you are using a development container on a virtual machine.

You can configure a development container for a repository so that the code space created for that repository provides you with a development environment tailored to your needs, complete with all the tools and runtimes you need to work on your specific project. If you don't define a configuration in your repository, GitHub Codespaces will use a default configuration that includes many of the common tools your team may need when developing projects.

Configuration files for the development container are contained in the .devcontainer directory of the repository. You can use Visual Studio Code to add the profile for you. You can choose from predefined configurations for various project types. You can use them without further configuration, or you can edit the configuration to improve the development environment they generate.

In devcontainer.json, you can add different language environments, different SDKs, and different cloud supports, as well as port configurations, and you can also set different plug-ins required by your project. You can also define and configure more content according to different needs.

### **Develop different applications through templates**

Now you can quickly create Rudy, Python, and JavaScript technology stack related content through templates. Here we take a Flask application as an example to create an application maintained through GitHub Codespaces.

### **Build a programming environment through an empty template**

If you are a user of .NET, Java, Rust or Go programming language, you can also complete related programming language learning through empty templates. Here I take .NET as an example to tell you how to build a .NET project.
