Hello everyone, this is an online Workshop based on GitHub Codespaces. I hope to tell you how to use GitHub Codespaces by combining different content, how to combine GitHub Codespaces as your own platform for learning programming languages, and maintain your projects through GitHub Codespaces, etc.

## **GitHub Codespaces Introduction**

Or you already know that GitHub Codespace is free for 60 hours a month from GitHub Universe 2022, but how to use GitHub Codespaces? How to configure your GitHub Codespaces environment? How do GitHub Codespaces work?
Through the study of this chapter, you can master the following content

1. What are GitHub Codespaces?
2. How to use GitHub Codespaces?
3. Build your Python project with templates from GitHub Codespaces
4. Build your .NET project from GitHub Codespaces' blank template

Study time: 40 minutes

## **Learn programming languages with GitHub Codespace**

Learning a programming language is a very important step on the road to programming. When we learn a programming language, we must install different environments including SDK, including some libraries, and plug-ins on the IDE. This takes up a lot of our time. Sometimes you will encounter all kinds of incompatible content. At this time, we can combine GitHub Codespaces to start an out-of-the-box development environment, so that as a beginner, you can quickly enter programming and experience the programming fun of different programming languages . By studying this chapter, you can master the following:

1. Learn .NET via GitHub Codespaces (<a href="./01.LearnCSharp.md">click to learn</a>)
2. Learn Java through GitHub Codespaces (<a href="./01.LearnJava.md">click to learn</a>)
3. Learn Python with GitHub Codespaces (updating)
4. Learn Rust with GitHub Codespaces (<a href="./01.LearnRust.md">click to learn</a>)
5. Learning Go with GitHub Codespaces (updating)
6. Learn NodeJS with GitHub Codespaces (updating)

Learning time: 180 min

## **Do cloud-native applications through GitHub Codespaces**

In GitHub Codespaces, you can directly develop and maintain cloud-native projects for enterprise development, and entrepreneurial teams can open up the development of any cloud platform through GitHub Codespaces. This series will use a few examples to guide you through the development and maintenance of cloud native projects through GitHub Codespaces.

1. Configure the cloud native development environment on GitHub Codespaces (<a href="./02.CloudNativeEnv.md">click to learn</a>)
2. Create an application combining Azure Static Web App and Azure Function through GitHub Codespaces (<a href="./02.CloudNativeInAzure.md">click to learn</a>)

## **Machine Learning via GitHub Codespaces (update ing)**

Machine learning is a very hot technology now. GitHub Codespaces brings very good technical support to machine learning. We can write machine learning well through GitHub Codespaces, and we can also connect with Azure Machine Learning Service so that everyone can make better use of it. Cloud resources to complete related machine learning projects. This series will introduce you how to use GitHub Codespaces to complete machine learning related knowledge.
