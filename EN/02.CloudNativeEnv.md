# **Configure the cloud-native development environment on GitHub Codespaces**

There are many cloud-native technologies at this stage, and we can deal with different cloud-native scenarios through GitHub Codespaces. For example, the development of containers, such as the configuration and maintenance of K8s application scenarios, can assist different projects to go to the cloud. This poses different challenges for the development team. First, the unity of the environment, and second, the integration of multiple scenarios and multiple technologies. Or you can think of GitHub Codespaces as an online Visual Studio Code in the cloud, but as for Visual Studio Code, its functions are not only compatible with plug-ins, but also support different cloud scenarios and templates. We can quickly build a cloud-native development environment through GitHub Codespaces. Next, we will build a cloud-native development environment through simple steps.

**1. Select an empty template to build a GitHub Codespaces project**

<img src="./imgs/02/01.png"/>

**2. And switch the machine configuration to 4-core CPU, 8GB memory, 32GB storage**

<img src="./imgs/02/02.png"/>

**3. Setting up the environment for GitHub Codespaces**

Use CMD + Shift + P for macOS, Ctrl + Shift + P for Windows / Linux Select Add Dev Container under Codespaces Select Ubuntu 22.04 development container (Ubuntu is the best development system for cloud native environment)

<img src="./imgs/02/03.png"/>

Version select jammy - 22.04

<img src="./imgs/02/04.png"/>

**4. Add support for different SDKs and locales**

Azure related such as Azure CLI, Azure Functions, etc.

Dotnet CLI , Miniforge , and nodejs etc.

After the selection is successful, you can refer to the following devcontainer.json configuration

```json

{
	"name": "Ubuntu",
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy",
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/azure-cli:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/dotnet:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/miniforge:0": {},
		"ghcr.io/jlaundry/devcontainer-features/azure-functions-core-tools:1": {}
	}


}

```

**5. Here you can add some extensions plug-ins for the environment**

Add the following statement to devcontainer.json to add .NET , Python , Thunder-Client and other plug-ins for your cloud-native GitHub Codespaces environment.

```json

	"customizations": {
         // Configure properties specific to VS Code.
		"vscode": {
		
		// Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
			"extensions": [
				"ms-python.python",
				"ms-python.vscode-pylance",
				"ms-dotnettools.csharp",
				"rangav.vscode-thunder-client"
			]
		}
    }


```

We can look at the complete devcontainer.json

```json

// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/ubuntu
{
	"name": "Ubuntu",
	// Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:jammy",
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/azure-cli:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/dotnet:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/miniforge:0": {},
		"ghcr.io/jlaundry/devcontainer-features/azure-functions-core-tools:1": {}
	},
	"customizations": {
         // Configure properties specific to VS Code.
		"vscode": {
		
		// Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
			"extensions": [
				"ms-python.python",
				"ms-python.vscode-pylance",
				"ms-dotnettools.csharp",
				"rangav.vscode-thunder-client"
			]
		}
    }

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

	// Use 'postCreateCommand' to run commands after the container is created.
	// "postCreateCommand": "uname -a",

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	// "customizations": {},

	// Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.
	// "remoteUser": "root"
}


```

6. When finished, Rebuild your GitHub Codespaces

<img src="./imgs/02/05.png"/>

Your environment is configured. Next, we try to build two projects to lay a solid foundation for subsequent connections.

Create a folder apps in the terminal, and build a subfolder of backend.app and frontend.app under apps

<img src="./imgs/02/06.png"/>

## **Project 1: Build a .NET Blazor Web Assbembly application**

1. Enter the frontend.app folder just created through the terminal

```bash

cd apps
cd frontend.app

```

2. Enter the following command under frontend.app to build a .NET Blazor Wasm application

```bash

dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazorUI.App

cd BlazorUI.App

dotnet restore

dotnet build

dotnet run

```

3. You can directly open the Blazor Wasm application in the browser

<img src="./imgs/02/07.png"/>


## **Project 2: Build an Azure Functions written in Python**

1. Enter the terminal, install and configure your Python


```bash

conda create -n pydev python=3.9.10

conda activate pydev


```

2. Use CMD + Shift + P for macOS, Ctrl + Shift + P for Windows/Linux, select Create Function under Azure Functions, select the previously built backend.app folder, select HttpTrigger and anonymous access, and name it AIOnnxHttpTrigger

3. Replace the files in https://github.com/kinfey/PythonOnnxDemo/tree/codespace-kinfey-bug-free-space-winner-gwjxj67qvv6fvr6/OnnxHttpTriggerDemo with the files under the AIOnnxHttpTrigger file

4. Start your Azure Functions via func start on the command line

```bash

func start

```
5. Verify through Thunder Client
